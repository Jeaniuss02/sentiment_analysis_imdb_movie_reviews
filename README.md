# sentiment_analysis_imdb_movie_reviews
For my final year project, I conducted sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using advanced deep learning techniques. I explored models such as CNN, BiLSTM, and BERT to evaluate their effectiveness in categorizing sentiment. 

Deep learning neural networks have made a great breakthrough in the field of text classification
in todayâ€™s world, where 328.77 million terabytes of data are created each day. An excessive 
amount of blogs, comments, and product and movie reviews will be difficult to analyze if there 
is no machine to help us automatically perform text classification. Sentiment analysis plays a 
crucial role in extracting meaningful information from a large amount of text data (i.e., 
comments, reviews, etc.). It is one of the major natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which 
mainly focuses on classifying sentiment polarity given a large amount of textual data. This 
report extensively explores the implementation and comparative evaluation of four deep 
learning models: CNN, BERT, BiLSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM for the classification of movie 
reviews. As a result, the CNN model demonstrated superior performance, and obtained a
competitive result among the implemented deep learning models with state-of-the-art 
techniques on the IMDb movie review dataset
